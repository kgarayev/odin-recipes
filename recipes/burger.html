    <h3>American Classic</h3>
    <p>Burger is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
